In her thesis Inga Glotzbach investigated a workflow making in-car payments accessible based on conversational technology. Focusing on protecting access to sensitive private data in the payment process, she designed an authorization process called Picture Passcode. To evaluate her design, she created a prototype to simulate a task load similar to driving. Taking advantage of the cui-prototyping-tool, she tested assumptions in usability tests and evaluated ergonomics in context.
